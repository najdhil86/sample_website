    <h3>Founders</h3>

      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael <strong><em>Hartl</em></strong> Hartl, Lee
      Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
      sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
      at least a billion people, and probably more.
